G4 sequence data were originally derived by Chambers et al. [6], and were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under accession number GSE63874. Across the genome, 716,311 observed G4 sequences were found in G4-stabilizing ligand pyridostatin (PDS) liquid and 525,908 observed G4 sequence were found in K+ liquid. Of these, 409,365 G4 sequences (K+: 78%, PDS: 57%) occurring in both experimental conditions were selected as our G4 sequences data.  //Integrative characterization of G-Quadruplexes in the three-dimensional chromatin structure, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2019.1621140
